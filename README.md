# BeatClikrNative.iOS
BeatClikr's reimplementation for iOS 17 with SwiftData, SwiftUI, and CloudKit. 

Note: This project relies on FontAwesome Pro 6 and a series of .WAV files that are not in git. You will need to add these yourself:

- FAPro fonts go with their default names in Resources/Fonts
- WAV files go with their correct names in Resources/Sounds
- See Constants/FileConstants for filenames

FontAwesome Pro is a paid font and distributing it is against its license. The WAV files are proprietary and I recorded them myself. You're free to use this code, but you'll need your own files. :D
